# lofi
Listen to "lofi hip hop - beats to relax / study to" or "ChillSynth FM" through the terminal (now with a math rock playlist too!)

## Dependencies:
+ yt-dlp
+ mpv

Both are very popular and should probably be on your distro's repositories.

## Usage:
```
$ lofi
      defaults to audio from lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to
      -c for ChillSynth FM - lofi synthwave radio for retro dreaming
      -a for audio only
      -v for video
      -v [quality] sets the video quality
      Use yt-dlp -F <video_url> for quality list
      --help displays this message
```
